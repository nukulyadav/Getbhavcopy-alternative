     I attempted to create a standalone EXE file using the PyInstaller module.
Although the standalone EXE file functions perfectly, But Microsoft Defender
antivirus identifies it as a false positive. Consequently, I am unable to 
distribute it in its current form. Instead, I will provide instructions on
how users can download the data using the source code.

To run the Python script "Getbhavcopy-Eq-Ind.py," please follow these steps:<br>
   1)  Install Python: If you haven't already installed Python on your computer,<br>      
            please download the latest version from the official Python website<br> 
            (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions.<br>

   2)  Download the Zip file from the following URL:<br>
            https://github.com/pparesh25/Getbhavcopy-alternative/archive/refs/heads/main.zip<br>
            Extract the contents of the Zip file and copy the file "Getbhavcopy-Eq-Ind.py" to your desktop.<br>

   3)  Right-click on an empty space on your desktop and select the option "Open in Terminal"<br>
            (or "Open PowerShell window here" depending on your operating system).<br>

   4)  In the opened terminal or PowerShell window,<br>
       install the required modules by typing the following command and pressing Enter<br>
          -->> pip install requests pandas <<-- <br>
        installation of modules is one time process after that you just need to follow step 5), 6) and 7)

   5)  After the installation is complete, download the end-of-day (EOD) data by typing the 
            following command in the terminal and pressing Enter-->> python Getbhavcopy-Eq-Ind.py <<-- <br>

   6)  The script will prompt you to enter a start date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" <br>
            Please enter the desired start date, e.g., 2023-05-01, and press Enter.<br>

   7)  Similarly, the script will prompt you to enter an end date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"<br> 
            Please enter the desired end date, e.g., 2023-05-25, and press Enter.<br>

     
       If your Python installation and required modules are correct, the script will proceed to download
the data and save it in the directory "C:/Get_bhav_copy NSE"

       Please follow these steps carefully, and let me know if you encounter any issues.
